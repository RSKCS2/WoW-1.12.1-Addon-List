ChangeLog RaidTargets Mod..

:: v1.3
	- TARGETMASTER is here. this is ideal for forcing FOCUSFIRE and the like.
		everybody running RTa can set his own Targetmaster. once activated you will always follow the target of your targetmaster the instant he switches... 
		btw... this also works for "STOP DMG" by losing any target...
		obviously this only works if the targetmaster is running RTa v1.3+
	- now updating the TargetIcons without RTa is realized by RTa.
	- the new AddonMsg format is now used by RTa for communication
	- with /RTa who   you will get a list of people who have the addon (and are in your raid)
	- now, RaidLeader can assign Infos to each Icon (and the other raidplayers with RTa will see them.) 
						This feature is a request from Micron	- thanks very much - due to the fact that many guils use the SKULL for 
						killing mobs, the moon for sheeping etc. now everybody can see what each symbol means...
	- you can scale RTa now by using /RTa scale X.Y
						where X.Y is > 0.3 and < 2
	- many settings are saved and restored now
	- some new slashcommands added - try /rta help
	- more communication between RTa of different players.. everybody should be updated by the leaders/officers upon targeticon changes now. also finding your target in case of anybody else having it already should be faster now.	

:: v1.2
	- getting your target now works without moving the mouse over a unit - if, of course, another player in the raid has that target

:: v1.1
	-	changed the SlashCommand to /rta
		:: this was done due to popular request (interference with raidtracker)
	- added ToggleButtons for 
		:: "Put Icon on Friendly Units"
		:: "Put Icon on Neutral Units"
		:: "Put Icon on Enemy Units"
	- added ToggleButton for "ToolTips"
	- obviously added the ToolTips as well
	- added MiniMize/MaxiMize Button
	- added "EnhancedTargetFind" ... well.. if anybody in your raid has the target you are looking for 
		(the one with the Icon you chose to be your TargetIcon), you will automatically target it. Else, you will
		still have to find it by moving the mousepointer over it....
:: v1.0
