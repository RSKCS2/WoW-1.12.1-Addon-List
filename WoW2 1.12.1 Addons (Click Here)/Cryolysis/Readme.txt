1 - What is Cryolysis?
-------------------------------

cry·ol·y·sis (kri-ol'i-sis) n. Destruction by cold.


Cryolysis is a mod to help mage managing their portals, conjured items, buffs, and spells.  
It provides a variety of buttons for common spells in an easy-to-use, small, convinient package.  
The idea and code was adapted from Necrosis LdC to make it usable by mages.

-------------------------------
1b- What isn't Cryolysis?
-------------------------------

Cryolysis will not give provide you with buttons for offensive spells. It will not take up a lot of 
screen space.  It will not make coffee or walk your dog.

-------------------------------
2 - Why should I use Cryolysis?
-------------------------------

Because it is wonderful and very intuitive! The interface is small and movable, opening up a lot more screen and bar 
space for whatever you want.  You won't need to clutter your screen with uncommon spells and you will
never have to search through your spellbook or inventory for magely things. You feel be a more efficient mage 
and have more fun thanks to this handy addon.

-------------------------------
3 - How does it work?
-------------------------------

Really simple, but very complex! My grandmother can do it.  Oh, well, you can bet my grandmother never intended 
to play online games. She thought that computers were devil machines which can provide illness and death. I think 
it is ashame to be so narrowminded. Well, anyway...

How does it work ? Well...


Cryolysis will provide you a sphere and 9 buttons. The sphere will display relevant information and the outer 
buttons will provide quick access to all your magely desires.

7 - FAQ
-------------------------------

Q: What is this Necrosis you keep mentioning?
A: My main character is a warlock and as such, I wanted to be the best warlock
   I could.  I found Necrosis LdC and fell in love with it.  On a Patch day if
   Necrosis would break, I wouldn't be able to play my warlock.  When I made
   My mage, I felt it could really benefit from a similar mod

Q: So you stole the code made by Lomig and Nyx?!
A: Yes and no.  I went through their code and changed a lot of things around so
   It would work for mage.  I also added my own code to certain places like 
   Mana gems, right-clicking buff menu, etc.  Before releasing, I asked permission
   and they said it would be fine, as long as I give them credit (which is well
   (deserved!)

Q: How often do you update?
A: I am constantly tweeking things.  Whenever I am on, I am trying to make Cryolysis better.  I suggest adding Cryolysis to your favorites so you can easily watch for updates, becuase they come by quickly!

Q: I'm not a mage, can you make this for my class?
A: Changing Necrosis to Cryolysis actually took a lot more work than I expected.  I was motivated, however, since I was just starting out my mage and I wanted to feel as at home there as I did on my warlock.  As of right now, I have no plans to work on a version for another class.  If I were to make another one, it would have to be for a class I was playing.  Most likely, it would come for rogue or hunter, as rogue is my next favorite class and I do not have a hunter on this server.

Q: Can I give you money?!
A: Of course!  please send your paypal donations to darklyte@gmail.com!

Q: Cryolysis... Is the name some kind of joke?
A: Kinda!  I wanted a Necrosis-like name, and mages come to the warlock forum so they can cry, so...

Q: Can I come talk to you on Aegwynn (Horde side)?
A: I have many characters.  About 10 or so, and I change on a whim.  Your best bet is to ask someone in my guild, <Working as Intended>, where I am.

Q: How else can I contact you?
A: E-mail: darklyte@gmail.com, AIM: darklyte64.  I also check curse-gaming, ui.worldofwar.net, and the official warcraft forums many times a day.  I will usually answer your questions within 12 hours.  Less if I am awake!
