	Ankh Cooldown Timer
	Originally by Starforce (starforce@playmate.se)
	Continued by Phanx (phanx1337@gmail.com)

	Gives shamans a timer for their reincarnation ability

	Version 1.7.0

	This is a standalone addon for World of Warcraft. It can be used in pure textmode,
	but it also has a GUI counter that can be turned on or off. It also plugs in with
	Titan Panel.


FEATURES:

	* Visible timer for your Reincarnation ability.

	* Movable GUI box that can be enabled/disabled.

	* Plugs in with TitanPanel.

	* Keeps track of how many ankhs you have.

	* Can display cooldown info in ankh tooltips.

	* Remembers the date and time you last reincarnated.


INSTALLATION:

	1. Extract the folder into World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns
	2. If installing for the first time, you must exit and restart the game.
	   If upgrading, you may either exit and restart, or simply type "/console reloadui" in-game.


USAGE:

	Type "/ankhct" or "/act" in-game to get a list of available commands!
