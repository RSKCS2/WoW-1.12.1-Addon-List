FearDance
By Toggol of Stormrage


DESCRIPTION:
FearDance is a stance-switching macro to aid warriors when using Berserker Rage.
For each button click, it switches from:
	Original Stance -> Berserker Stance -> Berserker Rage -> Original Stance

As a precautionary measure, FearDance does not trigger unless the "Berserker Rage" cooldown is complete.
This prevents "overshooting" back into Berserker Stance.


USAGE (MACRO):
Create a new macro that calls the following command. The first part will place a cooldown timer on your macro:

	/script -- CastSpellByName("Berserker Rage");/FearDance


USAGE (KEY BINDING):
Open the Key Binding panel. Look for the "FearDance" section, and bind it to your desired key.


OPTIONS:
	help - Displays a list of available options and their current status.

	debug <on | off> - This is the debug mode. It will display more information regarding your actions.
		By default, debug mode is set off.
