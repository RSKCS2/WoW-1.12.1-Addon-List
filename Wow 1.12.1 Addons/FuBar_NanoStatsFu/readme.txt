What is NanoStatsFu?

Short answer: NanoStatsFu brings the data from NanoStats into FuBar.

Longer (And more important and interesting) answer: NanoStatsFu integrates (Key word) NanoStats into FuBar with minimal overhead.

"Integrates? How so?" you ask? Well, When NanoStatsFu is present, NS won't generate it's tablet display - instead, the same code that creates the tablet display is used to make the NSFu's tooltip (Ya rly, the same code). The same code for generating a dropdown menu is also used for the FuBar Plugin (Ya rly, the same code).

The only new code introduced by NSFu is the code for writing text on the panel and the options for customising what you want on the panel.

All of this therefore keeps NSFu well within the 4 ultimate design goals as specified on the NS page, and damn small to boot!

Just like NanoStats itself, expect it to be fast, small and lightweight!
