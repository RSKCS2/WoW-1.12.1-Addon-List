Saturday September 24, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added likely fix for the Lua popup errors that occasionally appear.
* Added Barbed Lasher to the list of fixed creature types.

* Released 1.7.1.

Tuesday September 13, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Updated Interface number to 1700.
* Hooked event handler functions using the new GetScript functions, fixing a stack overflow caused by the old method.

* Added "fix" for the line 3 being odd colors.
* Released 1.7.0.

Monday September 5, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Fixed CreatureType case for "Constrictor Vine". Is now of type "Vine".

Sunday September 4, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Fixed a tooltip error when UnitLevel() was less than 0 but not a worldboss. This should fix the "Rexxar" bug.
* Released 0.3.1.

Thursday September 1, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added CreatureType cases for Oozes/Sludges/Slimes, so instead of "Not specified" it now displays "Ooze".
* Added CreatureType case for Zukk'ash insects in Feralas, now "Insect" instead of "Not specified".

Monday August 22, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added fix for item comparison tooltips by ignoring all non-(N)PC tooltips.
* Released 0.3.

Friday August 19, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added fix for bag item tooltips when vendor windows are open (don't call ClassicTooltip_Revert if event == "TOOLTIP_ADD_MONEY", since we'll never get that event on player & NPC tooltips, which is all I care about modifying).
* Added fix for "worldboss" NPCs (those who's level registers as -1 and who's unit classification is "worldboss"). I don't remember how those were handled prior to the new tooltips. If anyone else does, or has a screenshot, I'd be very grateful. For now, its Level = "??+". Kinda lame, but I can't think of anything better.

Thursday August 18, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Re-wrote the ClassicTooltip_Revert function to better handle the tooltip data.
* There should be no visible changes (aside from the extra line being gone in PartyFrames). The new function is easier to understand, and does things in a more logical manner.
* Released 0.2.

Wednesday August 17, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Added a slash-command to toggle display on/off. Only available in pre-1.0 & BETA/UNSTABLE releases.
* Added myAddons support.

Sunday August 14, 2005 - Link Dupont
* Released 0.1, first public release.
