PotHerbFu by Schelli

This addon gives you the possibility to monitor your pots and also your herbs and other ingreedients along with it

To get this fully working, log to your alchemist and import all pots available by using the menu (Gather data) or just use a control click on the addon
Next you got to use SHIFT mouseover to open the tooltip and select pots / herbs / misc stuff you want to be displayed in regular tooltip
From there just explore on... have fun
