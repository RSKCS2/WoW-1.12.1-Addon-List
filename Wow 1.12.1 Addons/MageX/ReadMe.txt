=== MageX === by Xsor === Release v.1.0

A special thanks to LittleMerlin of Suramar who bring me a
great idea for this Mage addon and for his patience of being the main beta tester !

Other thanks to all the team of Necrosis (The greatest Warlock addons and the only one you'll ever need).
They authorized me to use the awesome sound for critical hits in MageX.

Here's the official site of Necrosis : http://www.shadydesign.com/necrosis/

For any comments/suggestions please feel free to e-mail me (Xsor) at:   xsorath@gmail.com
And please tell me if you see any spelling mistake in the addon, i'm not so bad in english
but i can often mispell some words. Thanks.
i'll try to include a french version soon.

This is the first release so it's possible that you encounter bugs that we've never encounter ourselves,
so please communicate these bugs to me with a screenshot or complete message error if one is displayed.
So i'll be able to keep this addon as good as possible as soon as possible, particularly with incoming blizzard patches. :P
