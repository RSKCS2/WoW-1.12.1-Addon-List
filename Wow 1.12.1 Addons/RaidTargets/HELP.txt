-- HELP
RaidTargets assigns the new (since 1.11) RaidIcons to mobs that you move your mouse over. 
Furthermore, you can set your "TargetIcon" by clicking on the icon in the list. 
Now, when you activate the "FindTarget" function you will target the correct unit (the one with the correct icon).
As Icon distributer (RaidLeader) you can choose which Icons to distribute and which ones to leave untouched.

Assigning mobgroups is unbeliebably easy and fast now. just active the IconDistribution, move your mouse over the group and it's done! Garr targets = 1 second!

ADDITIONALLY! using the targetmaster function your raid will never again have problems with FocusFire or people
hitting wrong mobs. They simply have to put the correct playername into the editbox, activate it and they will always
get the target of that player - instantly upon any change... (also works for "STOP DMG" by losing any target)...

Operation is simple. Just bind Keys to the functions, or use /rta or /raidtargets to toggle the GUI. 
From the GUI you have buttons for assigning Icons or Finding Targets.

If there is some response and use I will be happy to add features that are requested.

Enjoy WoW!
