Notes on the 
DoubleClickSelfCast 
addon by BrainChild
v1.0 2006

Install

Notes
-----
This addon allows you to cast friendly spells on yourself by double clicking them.  
If you have a friendly player targeted when you click a spell, it will cast it on your target as normal.  
The self cast will only work if you have an enemy or nothing targeted.  Without this add-on a double click in this situation would cancel the spell.
This will work for any button on an actionbar be it script, spell, or a targeted use item.
It will not work on spells double clicked in the spell book (nor inventory I suppose- dont have something to test that with).
In this version, there is no way to disable the feature other than camping and disabling the addon.
