### Highly Recommended Addon‚ùó

Molten Core Protector (MCP) is an addon manager that provides an in-game button to enable, disable, and sort addons efficiently.  
Without MCP, addons must be managed manually.

## About

This collection of addons is from the original Vanilla WoW era (patch 1.12.1)  
and dates way before Blizzard revealed or released WoW Classic in 2019.  

All these addons should work on the old Vanilla 1.12.1 client or private servers emulating it.  

They **must NOT** be confused with:  
- WoW Classic (current retail, patch 1.15.5+)  
- Or any other newer Vanilla or Classic versions.

Use accordingly

These addons are from various creators across the WoW community.  
I do **not** own any of the addons and take **no credit** for their work.  
This project is purely for preservation and sharing, no money is made from it.
