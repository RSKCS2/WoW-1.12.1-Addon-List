## About

These addons are from various creators across the WoW community.  
I do **not** own any of the addons and take **no credit** for their work.  
This project is purely for preservation and sharing, no money is made from it.

## How to Use

Browse the list of addons in the folder below and follow each addon’s instructions to install.

## Recommended Addon Manager

If you want an easy way to manage, sort, and toggle all your addons in WoW 1.12.1, you should really download and install **Molten Core Protector (MCP)**.

MCP adds a convenient button in-game that lets you quickly enable or disable your addons without leaving the game. It’s lightweight, reliable, and made specifically for Vanilla WoW.

Make sure to grab MCP to get the best addon management experience for this version!
