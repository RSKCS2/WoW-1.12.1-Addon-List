## About

These addons are from various creators across the WoW community.  
I do **not** own any of the addons and take **no credit** for their work.  
This project is purely for preservation and sharing, no money is made from it.

## How to Use

Browse the list of addons in the folder below and follow each addon’s instructions to install.

## Recommended Addon Manager

Molten Core Protector (MCP) is an addon manager that provides an in-game button to enable, disable, and sort addons efficiently.  
Without MCP, WoW 1.12.1 addons must be managed manually.
