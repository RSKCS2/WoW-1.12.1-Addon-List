IsAttacking, version 1.2 (10900)

This addon enables functions related to auto attack, auto shot and your wand. I've seen quite a few posts on the official UI forum about determining if auto-attack is on. For example, you'll have a hard time doing a macro to turn off your auto-attack, as the only function available toggles it between on and off.

Why should anyone use this addon?
 - Very simple, low memory addon.
 - Shorter and easier macros

Complete list of functions:
 - InCombat() will return true only if you are in combat.
 - IsAttacking() will return true only if auto attack is on.
 - IsAutoShooting() will return true only if the hunter ability Auto Shot is on.
 - IsWanding() will return true only if you are using a wand.
 - AttackOn() will activate auto-attack
 - AttackOff() will deactivate auto-attack
 - AutoShotOn() will activate Auto Shot
 - AutoShotOff() will deactivate Auto Shot
 - WandOn() will activate your wand
 - WandOff() will deactivate your wand
