The Addon TargetCheck lists the Players in your Raid/Party who also select your target. Might be helpfull for Healers. Is helpfull for CC and Target Assignments, especialy in AdHoc environments.

Move the frame with shift click, resize it with alt click. There's also a Right Click Context Menu for some settings. This does not work with mouse anchor.
