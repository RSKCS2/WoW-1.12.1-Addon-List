ChatKeys v 1.53 by Zax - September 2006, 4th.
------------------------------------------------------------------

This AddOn is based on:
	- EasyChatChange AddOn by Toewalker
	- Alternative Global Strings AddOn by Viper

Partial german localization by DaMadness.

Tired of opening the chat window and typing "/p " to start a party message, or "/3 " to start a message on the defense channel? 
The main goal of this WoW AddOn is to allow you to bind keys - from the standard shortcuts panel - to start chat messages for all the following standard channels:
	- say
	- yell
	- party
	- raid (if applicable, else LocalDefense)
	- raid warning
	- guild
	- guild officers
	- General
	- Trade
	- Local defense
	- Group search

ChatKeys offers others bindable keys:
	- a key to start a message on a custom channel, defined with an interface.
	- a key to display who is connected to the defined custom channel.
	- a key to start an emote (/em).
	- a key to perform a "/who" query on the last player who whispered you, or on the player you have whispered to.
	- a key to whisper to a defined friend. This (girl/boy)friend's name can be defined with an interface.
	- a key to whisper to your target, assuming your target is a friendly player.

Other features:
	- ChatKeys removes annoying [Guild], [Party], [Raid], [Whisper to], [Whisper from] prefix from chat. [Officer] prefix is replaced by [OFF]. [Read Leader] prefix is replaced by [LEAD]. [Raid alert] prefix is replaced by [ATT].
	- BattleGround special feature: if the raid channel isn't applicable, the LocalDefense channel will be opened (thanks to BallaRa for this).
	- Optionnaly plays a sound. Please note that this feature is disabled because now WoW already plays sound when a whisper is received.

Quick Start
------------------------------------------------------------------
Just open the standard shortcut panel (keybindings) and bind keys for ChatKeys.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Development note
------------------------------------------------------------------
This AddOn searches asked channels by name and not by number because channels numbers can varies.
That's why it is localization-dependant and will not work with unlocalized language.
Thanks to DaMadness for is german localization.
