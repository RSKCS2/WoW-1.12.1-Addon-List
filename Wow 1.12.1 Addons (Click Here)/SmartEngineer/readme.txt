SmartEngineer v0.4
Created by ScepraX.

"The purpose of this mod is to help engineers to easily use their devices and explosives."
This mod works through commands, macros and keybindings. It has no nice interface or extensions for other mods.

----------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THIS MOD USED FOR?
----------------------------------------------------------------
This mod is meant for engineers to easily use their created explosives.
This mod has several functions for that. Main function include:
	- A smart explosive function that will pick the best explosive out of user defined categories.
	- A couple of functions to pick a explosive out of a specific category.
	- Commands to select the explosive to use in the smart function.
	
Categories:
	- Dynamite: Includes all engineer and non-engineer dynamites. Basically includes all raw explosives.
	- Bombs and Grenades: Includes all engineer made bombs and grenades, except the Arcane Bomb. This category includes only stunning explosives.
	- Charges: Includes all engineer made charges.
	- Other: This catergory includes:
- Explosive Sheep: Summons an Explosive Sheep which will charge at a nearby enemy and explode for 135 to 165 damage. Lasts for 3 min or until it explodes.
- Flash Bomb: Causes all Beasts in a 5 yard radius to run away for 10 sec.
- Goblin Land Mine: Places the Goblin Land Mine on the ground. It will explode for 394 to 506 fire damage the next time a hostile creature passes near it. The mine has a duration of 1 min.
- Goblin Sapper Charge: Explodes when triggered dealing 450 to 750 Fire damage to all enemies nearby and 375 to 625 damage to you.
- Arcane Bomb: Drains 675 to 1125 mana from those in the blast radius and does 50% of the mana drained in damage to the target. Also Silences targets in the blast for 5 sec.

By default the smart function only uses explosives from the first 2 categories.
Reason for this is that charges are only used for locks and explosives from the other categorie are too specific in their use. (No use throwing an Arcane Bomb to a warrior.)

Withing the other category any of the items can be disabled using commands. This has effect both on the smart function and abnormal function.

This mod also supports target dummies using a different command.
